# Flappy Hadida

A one-button township flyer. The hero is a cartoon hadeda ibis, bill to the right. The gates are braai drums, minibus slices, pylon discs, and protea columns. One flap. Haa-haa energy.

Canvas volumetric cartoon. No WebGL. Soft-currency chests only.

## Play

[https://toszk-hub.github.io/flappy-hadida/](https://toszk-hub.github.io/flappy-hadida/)

The playable is on `main` and is meant to be served from `/` (root). Publishing needs a repository admin to open Settings → Pages and choose Deploy from a branch, `main`, `/ (root)`. Creating that site from this token returned 403: GitHub requires `pages=write` and `administration=write`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TosZK-Hub/flappy-hadida.git
cd flappy-hadida
npx serve
```

Open the URL `npx serve` prints. Serve the folder that contains `index.html`.

## Controls

**PLAY** is the gold button. Only that rectangle starts a run, along with Space or Arrow Up. The hero, the collection strip, and the sky do not.

In the air, tap or press Space to flap. A held key does nothing extra.

After a crash:

- **HOME** returns to the menu and does not restart.
- **CHALLENGES** and **CHESTS** open those panels and do not start a run.
- **RESTART** is the only gold button. A tap away from it does not start the next run.

- **M** mutes the beeps. The speaker chip does too.
- **1–9** equip a costume you already own. **Q** / **[** and **E** / **]** / **C** cycle owned costumes.
- **H** draws the 34×24 hitbox.
- **Escape** closes chests, collection, or challenges.

## Coins and chests

Coins are the only soft currency. They stay in this browser. An old nug balance migrates to coins once, one for one. A save that still says `starter_tee` (or an older blunt skin id) maps onto the Hadida roster once.

A run banks **+1 coin per stack cleared**, plus a near-miss skim of **+1** when the hitbox edge passes within 6px of a lip, capped at **+5** per run. The first run of a calendar day adds **+10** coins. The streak count caps at **7** and resets after a missed day.

| Chest | Cost | Pull |
|-------|------|------|
| Street | 100 | Common 70% · Rare 24% · Epic 5.5% · Legendary 0.5% |
| Township | 300 | Common 40% · Rare 40% · Epic 17% · Legendary 3% |
| Bok | 750 | Common 15% · Rare 40% · Epic 35% · Legendary 10% |

Costumes come from chests. Park Hadida (`starter_hadida`) is free. A duplicate refunds **40%** of that chest. After 10 Street opens with no Rare or better, the next Street pull is at least Rare. After 5 Township or Bok opens with no Epic or better, the next pull is at least Epic. Owning all 12 costumes grants **Full flock** and **+150** coins once.

There is no skin shop, no IAP, no ads, and no mid-run pay power-up.

## Feel lock

Numbers live in `js/feel.js`. A flap **sets** upward speed to **−440**. Gravity is **1450**. Fall caps at **540**. The hitbox is **34×24** and does not change with costume or squash.

Scroll, gap, and spacing follow Teach, Warm, Rise, Heat, and Legend in `art/hadida/TOTAL_UPGRADE_MECHANICS.md`. Gap never goes under **128**. Scroll caps at **250**. The first gate can touch you **1.4s** after the run starts.

From score **16**, pairs cycle Straight, Rise, Fall, and Breath. From score **31**, one pack in four bobs **±8px** at **0.55 Hz**, with an amber lip mark before it enters. Flap squash is draw-only: **sx 0.88 / sy 1.12** for **70–90ms**.

Best score titles: **Rookie** at 10, **Squad** at 25, **Legend** at 50.
